# Create vectors from your data

In order to search your data, you will need to create embeddings for your documents. Embeddings are vectors that represent your documents in a vector space. The vector space is a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a feature of your documents.

Many services offer pre-trained models that you can use to create embeddings for your documents.

For this tutorial, we will provide you with an endpoint that will return the embeddings for a given search term.

## Configuring the application

In your `server/.env` file, you'll find a few variables that you can use to configure the application.

The first one is `EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE`. It tells the application where to get the embeddings from. You can set it to `serverlessEndpoint`.

Your instructor will provide you with an API key that you can use for the event you're attending. Set it in the `EMBEDDING_KEY` variable.

```
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=serverlessEndpoint
EMBEDDING_KEY=<API Key>
```
