# Create vectors from your data

In order to search your data, you will need to create embeddings for your documents. Embeddings are vectors that represent your documents in a vector space. The vector space is a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a feature of your documents.

Many services offer pre-trained models that you can use to create embeddings for your documents.

For this tutorial, we will provide you with an endpoint that will return the embeddings for a given search term.

If you want to learn how to create your own vectors, check out the next sections that will guide you through the process with some of the most popular providers.
