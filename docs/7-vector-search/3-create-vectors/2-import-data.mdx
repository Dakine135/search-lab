# Import Vectorized Data

In the context of this workshop, you might not have enough time to vectorize your own data. Therefore, we have provided a vectorized version of the data for you to use.

The data has been pre-encoded using various providers, so you can use the one that you are most comfortable with.

Keep in mind that your queries will need to be encoded with the same provider as the data.

The model that was used for each data set is listed below:

| Data Set | Model |
| -------- | ----- |
| Google Vertex | multimodalembedding@001 |
| OpenAI | text-embedding-ada-002 |
| SageMaker |   |

## Import the embeddings

To import the dataset with the pre-created embeddings, you can use the [import tool](https://mdb.link/import-library-data) that you used earlier.

Enter your connection string in the text box at the top, and pick your provider from the dropdown at the bottom of the screen.

:::tip
If unsure, or don't want to create your own embeddings, you can use the `OpenAI` provider.
:::

Once you picked your provider, click on the `Add Embeddings` button.

:::warning
This process will drop your existing `books` collection to replace it with a new one. Any existing indexes or changes to your collection will be lost.

Once the import is complete, you will see a confirmation message.
