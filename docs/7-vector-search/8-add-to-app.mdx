# üëê Add semantic search to your application

You now know everything you need to add vector search capabilities to your application.

## Configuring the application

In your `server/.env` file, you'll find a few variables that you can use to configure the application. We will add a couple more.

The first one is `EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE`. It tells the application where to get the embeddings from. If you're following along in the context of an in-person lab, you can set it to `serverlessEndpoint`.

Your instructor will provide you with an API key that you can use for the event you're attending. Set it in the `EMBEDDING_KEY` variable (or `API_KEY` for Amazon SageMaker).

If you are using one of the other providers, you can use the following settings in the file `server/.env`.

<Tabs groupId="aiproviders">
  <TabItem value="serverless" label="Serverless Endpoint" default>

```
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=serverlessEndpoint
EMBEDDING_KEY=<API Key>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="openai" label="OpenAI" default>

```
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=openai
EMBEDDING_KEY=sk-...
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="googleVertex" label="Google Cloud Vertex AI">

```
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=googleVertex
EMBEDDING_KEY="./path_to_your_credentials.json"
PROJECT_ID=<Project ID>
PROJECT_LOCATION=<Project Location>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



Open up the code from the server file `server/src/controllers/books.ts` once more, and edit the `searchBooks` method to query your data for semantic search.

:::tip
Use the `getEmbeddings` function to convert the query into a vector.

<div>

```js
public async searchBooks(query: string): Promise<Book[]> {
  const vector = await getEmbeddings(query);
  const aggregationPipeline = [
    {
      $vectorSearch: {
        queryVector:  vector,
        path: 'embeddings',
        numCandidates: 100,
        index: 'vectorsearch',
        limit: 100,
      }
    }
  ];
  const books = await collections?.books?.aggregate(aggregationPipeline).toArray() as Book[];
  return books;
}

```
</div>
</details>

To test it, try to search for things that have the same meaning, but using words that are not in the title, synopsis, etc. For instance "Canines doing stuff" should return books related to dogs.
